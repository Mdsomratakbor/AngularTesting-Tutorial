### How Angular Unit test case Flow?

- `The Angular testing package includes two utilities called` **TestBed and async**
- `TestBed is the main Angular utility package.`
- `The describe container contains different blocks (it, beforeEach, xit, etc.).` 
- **beforeEach** `runs before any other block. Other blocks do not depend on each other to run.`
