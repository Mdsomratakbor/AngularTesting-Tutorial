### What is Karma?
`Karma is a direct product of the AngularJS team from struggling to test their own framework features with existing tools. As a result of this, they made Karma and have transitioned it to Angular as the default test runner for applications created with the Angular CLI.`

`In addition to playing nicely with Angular, it also provides flexibility for you to tailor Karma to your workflow. This includes the option to test your code on various browsers and devices such as phones, tablets, and even a PS3 like the YouTube team.`

`Karma also provides you options to replace Jasmine with other testing frameworks such as Mocha and QUnit or integrate with various continuous integration services like Jenkins, TravisCI, or CircleCI.`

`Unless you add some additional configuration your typical interaction with Karma will be to run ng test in a terminal window.`
